        desc: "<p>Trick and Treat was the first of three games I worked on for my Game Design and Development course that I took during my third year at RIT. The game was built in five weeks using Unity 4. It is a 2D beat 'em up style game about a delusional \"ghost buster\" who takes to the streets on Halloween to rid the world of ghosts. It is a very silly game that I had a lot of fun working on.</p><p>We had a team of eight people building the game, which was the largest team I had ever worked with up to that point. I was primarily the gameplay programmer on the team. I worked on basically anything that wasn't AI or UI. I programmed features such as player movement and actions, as well as systems such as the infinitely scrolling level and parallaxed background.</p><p>Trick and Treat holds a special place in my heart as one of my favorite projects I've ever worked on. Firstly, because it was the first time I had worked with a team on a game in Unity, after about three years of messing around with the engine on my own. And things went great! The team worked very well together and we had so many people that each team member got to specialize in something that interested them. We had four programmers, three artists, and even a sound designer which was another first for a project I worked on.</p><p>Though, one of the things I am most proud of about Trick and Treat is that the game was my idea. For the course, each person in the class had to give a presentation and pitch a game idea. As an added design challenge, the game had to involve a vacuum cleaner somehow. I never really considered myself much of a design guy, but I thought of a funny idea and decided to roll with it. After the presentations, everyone voted on the games they wanted to work on and seven other people ended up working on this game with me.</p>"

The game was created after the completion of Trick and Treat with several of the same team members and, like Trick and Treat, was built in five weeks using Unity 4. Southern, But Love is a 2D infinite runner about a pair of lovers who must navigate their way through the treacherous bayous of the deep south. If it wasn’t obvious, we decided to step up the silliness for this project.</p><p>For this project, we had a team of five people working on the game. Four of which, myself included, had previously worked together on Trick and Treat. I reprised my role as gameplay programmer for this project as well, though I also helped with the UI and the system we set up for building levels procedurally. The way we constructed the level was actually one of the features I enjoyed building the most. Rather than scattering obstacles randomly and calling it a day, one of our team members designed several small obstacle courses in CSV format. The game then read in those CSV’s, built the level segments, and strung them together to build the level.</p><p>One of my favorite parts of working on Southern, But Love was continuing to work with the people I had met and worked so well with on Trick and Treat. We had the same artists, and borrowed heavily from Trick and Treat when building the gameplay, which gave our team and our work a recognizable identity. And we continued to work together. Though, we decided to change things up quite a bit for our third and final game, <a href=https://github.com/Nolnocn/Sunder-Scene target=\"_blank\">Sunder Scene</a>.</p>"

        desc: "<p>The Patrol is an autonomous agent simulation that I created as my final project for my Interactive Media Development course during my second year at RIT. It was built in about a week using Unity 3. The simulation features a squad of knights who march from their village off into the dark forest to combat an invasion of skeletons. The simulation is no interactive, but the player is able to freely move the camera to observe. It was a relatively short project that built upon previous assignments, but I got an opportunity to really focus on aesthetics and make a decent looking simulation.</p><p>To create the simulation, I implemented and utilized several autonomous agent behaviors such as seeking, separation, obstacle avoidance, leader following, and flow. Initially, the knights follow their leader down a trail to the forest. After reaching the end of the trail, the knights fan out and patrol the forest. The spawning of the skeletons is delayed so that the first wave spawns in time to meet the knights at the end of the trail. The skeletons follow a flow field through the forest towards the trail, and target the knights when they come into range. When a skeleton or knight has a target, they move towards it and fight it when in range. Only one combatant walks away.</p><p>One thing of note about this project was that it was the first time I relied heavily on the Unity Asset Store and other sources for game assets. With many of my solo projects in the past, I tended to be very stubborn about doing everything myself. My own programmer art wouldn’t look particularly great, but I’d proudly call it my own. For this project, however, I didn’t have the time or ability to make assets, so I looked around on the Unity Asset Store and various other sites for art that would fit. I still hogged all the programming for myself, but it was a step in the right direction and it helped me appreciate working with a team much more.</p>"
