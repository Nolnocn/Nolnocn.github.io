The game was created after the completion of Trick and Treat with several of the same team members and, like Trick and Treat, was built in five weeks using Unity 4. Southern, But Love is a 2D infinite runner about a pair of lovers who must navigate their way through the treacherous bayous of the deep south. If it wasn’t obvious, we decided to step up the silliness for this project.</p><p>For this project, we had a team of five people working on the game. Four of which, myself included, had previously worked together on Trick and Treat. I reprised my role as gameplay programmer for this project as well, though I also helped with the UI and the system we set up for building levels procedurally. The way we constructed the level was actually one of the features I enjoyed building the most. Rather than scattering obstacles randomly and calling it a day, one of our team members designed several small obstacle courses in CSV format. The game then read in those CSV’s, built the level segments, and strung them together to build the level.</p><p>One of my favorite parts of working on Southern, But Love was continuing to work with the people I had met and worked so well with on Trick and Treat. We had the same artists, and borrowed heavily from Trick and Treat when building the gameplay, which gave our team and our work a recognizable identity. And we continued to work together. Though, we decided to change things up quite a bit for our third and final game, <a href=https://github.com/Nolnocn/Sunder-Scene target=\"_blank\">Sunder Scene</a>.</p>"
