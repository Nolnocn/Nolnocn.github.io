<p>This doesn't look terrible. Could be a little more unique, but I'm not really a web designer. More of a codey-code guy myself. I'd rather just have a site to put my stuff up on and call it a day. It's not like someone will look at some fancy-smancy site I built and think "gee, this guy made a nice site, I better hire him as a gameplay programmer."</p>

<p>It would be pretty cool, though I'd prefer to direct more attention to my projects. I guess making a site would be a project on its own, but it'd be more design-y. I don't think I'd be wowing anyone with my website's functionality. But I digress. I just wanted to see how a paragraph or two would look when published.</p>

<p>Note to self, change this before people start looking at it.</p>

<p>P.S. If you read this, you just wasted your time.</p>
